# Fix Me Dockerstyle

Using this repo build an image and push it to your public dockerhub so we can run it (make sure to send back your imagename/tag).

There are many ways to make this work and we'd like to explore what you did.  So at a minimum please attempt to fix the existing Dockerfile and make sure to include the entire repo into the docker container (and explain why this isn't always a great idea) and submit the tag name back.

Make sure its public so we can pull it.


## To test
When this container has run successfully you should see the dpkg result for curl and the echo "This script is totally running!".

We will execute `docker run yourimagename/yourtag` first, and then inspect it.
